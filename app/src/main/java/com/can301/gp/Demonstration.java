/**
 * Represents a demonstration
 *
 * Contains all the information needed to identify a demonstration,
 * all the information needed to navigate to a page about a demonstration,
 * and all the information needed to show a demonstration's effect
 *
 * Each instance will be created by hand and should be immutable,
 * therefore, all fields will be public.
 *
 * One problem that I encountered when implementing the design of the code & effect pages
 * is that each effect has its own activity while there is only one unified code activity.
 * Therefore, the code activity has to somehow know how to get the the corresponding effect activity.
 * (Remember that normally the class of the activity is passed to the constructor of Intent).
 * However, this means each effect activity has to tell the code activity the class of itself
 * through an Intent, which is not straightforward as a Class object cannot be passed as an Intent
 * extra.
 * My solution for this problem is to let each effect activity pass its Activity Name as a String
 * to the code Activity, which uses Intent.setComponentName to navigate to the correct Activity.
