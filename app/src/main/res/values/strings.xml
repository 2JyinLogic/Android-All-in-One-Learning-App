    <string name="bg_service_example_desc">
        A background service performs an operation that isn\'t directly noticed by the user.
        In this example, a BG service will be created to repeatedly increase the value of an integer by 1 and sleep for a few seconds.
        Note how running the service in the UI thread will freeze the UI and eventually leads to the app being killed.
    </string>
    <string name="bound_service_example_desc">
        A bound service is an implementation of the Service class that lets other applications bind to it and interact with it.
        To provide binding for a service, you implement the onBind() callback method.
        This method returns an IBinder object that defines the programming interface that clients can use to interact with the service.

        In this example, a bound and started service will be created to play music in the background.
        You can bind to the service to control the music play, but even after you unbind, the music is still being played,
        unless you stop the service.
